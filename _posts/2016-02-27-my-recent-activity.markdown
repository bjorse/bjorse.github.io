It has been a long while ago since I last updated this blog, but I haven't been idling much (as you may think). Apart from spending time with my family when not being at work, I've been reading up on (and trying out) various things. Not only Elm actually, but other things as well that I feel I've fallen behind on knowing, and things that may be good to have *some* knowledge about.

I've also attended my first Elm meetup, which was really great. It was refreshing meeting other people that share the same ambition of wanting to learn something that's not really mainstream yet. But, Elm in production seems to become a highly viable choice for a growing group of developers now which comforts me, and gives me hope.

I haven't worked much on my personal project either, but I've been coding *a lot* (well, the small amount of my "free time" is filled with coding activities at least). I'm discovering new amazing tools all the time, and my [sucky web development computer][hp-stream] still copes with me, although Chrome tries its best to bring us down, and we've hit the brick wall a few times considering amount of free resources. But overall, this computer has been a really good companion so far.

Updates will keep on coming!
