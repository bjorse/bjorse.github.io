I feel really bad for previously doubting the greatness of Elm. To be completely honest, it was the type system that scared me off at first (after getting used to dynamic typing through other languages). But the type system in Elm is amazing, and is like nothing else I've seen before (it's very much like Haskell they say). It rather helps in a way that still keeps me productive, and it supports me the right way by not being limiting and getting on my nerves. With that said, when getting past my initial allergic reaction to type systems overall (not Elm in particular), I could let myself look beyond and actually see what the language offers, and I'm totally intrigued by it. Speed, productivity, and FP in the web... Gimme!

So, although my love for Clojure/ClojureScript remains, Elm and Phoenix seems to be a great match, so I'll have to go with Elm on this one!

(short post today, but this is everything I have to say, I must get back to coding!)
