I'm so *tired* of other people seemingly not wanting to evolve as a developer. They're stuck in (usually) *one* language, not wanting to learn something new. Whatever the reason is - laziness, fear, lack of time - they're usually very eager to tell others who *want* to learn something, why *you shouldn't* learn something new. It's especially exhausting when these people are constantly nearby, wanting to drag you down with them. Many developers I know want to learn new languages and technologies only when exposed to them at work - I'm totally fine by that, and they're not the audience I'm targetting in this post. I'm talking about the energy drainers, those who are very energetic opponents to anything new.

Personally, I want to learn new stuff every day, because I've seen how it has made me a better developer. I bet most of you will agree that this is the case for you too. Personally, I don't want to wait for opportunities to appear at work, I want to learn about stuff I'm personally interested in, not only stuff I'm *forced* to learn because I'd otherwise be out of work.

I started with Delphi (yes, I know) ages ago, long before I even thought about becoming a professional developer. Back then, I didn't know any design patterns or even how to write proper code, I just googled code snippets and tutorials and put something together. Most of the time the code compiled and the application did what it was supposed to do. But I often wondered how to structure the code, because I realised it was very complicated to write code, and that it wasn't just about getting some application up and running. During this time, I met a *real* developer (who would later become a coworker) whom I could ask these very questions, and I would receive very good answers as well of course. He recommended me to look at C# instead of Delphi (I was mainly interested in Windows development at this time), so I downloaded Visual Studio Express and got started. Immediately I realised C# was a better language for me, and after getting introduced to design patterns I started to understand how to write more structured code. Now, I've recently seen some of my code from this time, and to put it frankly, I didn't know shit. I *thought* I did, but I *really* didn't. Just to get that clear.

Still being a happy amateur developer, my love for coding grew bigger every day, and it didn't take long before I applied for a job. After getting hired as a junior developer, I got exposed for new technologies on a daily basis. Although, C# remained my main language (and unfortunatly it still is, professionally). I got in touch with other languages, like Java and JavaScript, but they didn't reach me at the time. But then I met Ruby, and Ruby in Rails. I just loved Ruby and its syntax with dynamic typing. And `unless`, wow! ;)

With Ruby on Rails, I started to explore how to do web applications, and with web development comes JavaScript. *Another* language with dynamic typing, bingpot! At work, there were a lot of talk about something called *functional programming*, and JavaScript was my first exposure with something I thought was functional programming. Looking back, my definition of what I thought was functional programming was *way* wrong (I wont get into any details of my misunderstanding, but if you're not sure what functional programming is, save some time and read [this excellent article][fp-article]).

The important thing here is that thanks to my coworkers and JavaScript, I got interested in functional programming and wanted to learn what it was, because I realised it was something really good. I started reading [Functional JavaScipt][js-functional-book] (I had to read it several times due to it being very tough to read and understand). Still not *really* understanding functional programming, things explained in that book improved my programming skills in many other ways. I started to write even cleaner code, worrying about state, avoiding unnecessary side effects, and generally starting to question the object oriented ways.

This year I got to learn Clojure, and boy, my life hasn't been the same since. After being frustrated with C# for a while, because although I was following all the design patterns and the best practices on how to write code in object oriented languages, it still was very complicated to write great code. Abstractions, ceremonial code, and generally not focusing on the *essence* of what I was supposted to do. I was supposed to write code that implemented some functionality, but instead I was writing all these abstractions where I was hiding data. *Why?* When exploring Clojure, this was my thought through it all: *finally I'm getting shit done*. Like, seriously. I wont go any deeper into why functional programming is superior to anything else, because I'm sure you're already familiar with the reason why (if you're not, didn't you read [this article][fp-article]?).

My next language to learn is Elixir, and hopefully I will learn something important this time around as well. It may not be something as significant as when I learned JavaScript or Clojure, but I'm sure it will make me a better programmer in some way. Maybe it's something to use in an upcoming project at work?

The point of this post is that I want to evolve, and very fast. Sure, I'd evolve with just coding C# and reading articles about stuff concerning the .NET world, but I may not evolve as quickly as I want to do, and certainly not in the way I want to. Ideally, I would use Clojure professionally as well and evolve even quicker, but for now that's not the case.

Bottom line: if you want to stay with your language for all eternity, that's fine by me, but don't tell me not to evolve, because that's none of your business.
